# Container Tutorial

This is a tutorial on how to create your first container, which is especially useful for those who are curious about Podman or will need to use Podman for a course. Additionally, the knowledge gained here will be valuable in effectively managing your future containers for your courses.

On Windows devices and Macs, podman uses a virtual machine to create ad run containers.  Let's start by initializing and starting our machine using the following commands:

```
podman machine init
podman machine start
```
>Note: This process could take a couple minutes. 

This creates a podman machine with the default name podman-machine-default. 
To confirm if the machine has been successfully started, execute the following command:

```
podman machine info
```

With the machine up and running, let's now create our first container! In this example, we'll create a "Hello World" container. Run this command: <code><b>podman run --name hello-world-container hello-world</b></code>

Upon successful execution, you will see output similar to this:

<p align="center">
   <img src="images/hello_world.png" alt="Hello World Output" > 
</p>

To remove the container, simply run <code><b>podman rm hello-world-container</b></code>

By following these steps, you will have initialized your machine, created and run your first container, and removed it when no longer needed.
