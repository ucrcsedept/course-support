# Podman Installation -- macOS: Ventura 

If you fall into any of the following categories, we recommend using this method and work with Podman:

1. If you are simply curious about Podman and wish to explore it beyond the classroom setting.
2. If you prefer working on a local machine instead of a remote one.
3. If the remote method is not working as expected for you.

However, in all other cases, we advise you to utilize the pre-configured containers available on the UCR servers. This will lead to a smoother and more optimized experience for your specific needs.

## Prerequisites -- Xcode & Homebrew

Before proceeding with the installation of Podman, it is essential to confirm that certain prerequisites are met. We will first check for Xcode and Homebrew, and if necessary, install them before moving forward. This will ensure a smooth and successful installation process.

Navigate to your terminal, and run the following command
>Note: You can open the terminal by either pressing cmd + space and searching for "terminal" or by navigating to your launchpad and searching for "terminal."
```
xcode-select --version
```
If Xcode is already installed, your terminal will return the current version. Otherwise, you can follow the steps provided in the drop-down list below.
>A clear indication that it is not installed is when you encounter the following error message: **zsh: command not found: XCode-select**
<details>
<summary>Xcode Installation</summary>
To install XCode, run the following command in your terminal
```
xcode-select --install
```

After running the command, a pop-up will appear. Choose the "Install" option and follw by clicking "Agree" to the license agreement. XCode will now begin installing. This may take a few minutes. Once the installation process is complete, simply click "Done" on the pop-up that confirms the software has been installed.

To check if the installation was successful, run the following command
```
xcode-select --version
```
The terminal should output the current version of Xcode.

The second requirement for Podman is Homebrew. To check if you have Homebrew installed on your system, enter the following command in your terminal
```
brew --version
``` 
If Homebrew is already installed, your terminal will return the current version. Otherwise, you can follow the steps provided in the drop-down list below.
>A clear indication that it is not installed is when you encounter the following error message: **zsh: command not found: brew**

<details>
<summary>Homebrew Installation</summary>

To begin the installation, navigate to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew page</a>.

You will now see the following:

<p align="center">
   <img src="images/homebrew.png" alt="Homebrew Paste Icon" width = "850" height = "300"> 
</p>

To copy the script, simply click on the clipboard icon located to the right of the command, and then paste it directly into your terminal.

The terminal may prompt you for 'sudo access'. Enter the admin password to the terminal. You may not see the characters you are typing; this is normal.
>Note: Your admin password is the same password you use to log into your Mac.

After entering your password, a list will be displayed showing what is going to be installed and where. Press the **return** key on your keyboard to continue. The installation will now begin and may take a few minutes.

Once Homebrew has been installed, locate the following lines
```
==> Next steps:
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    (echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew/ shellenv)"') >> /Users/kennythai/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
The two commands will vary slightly for every system. **DO NOT COPY** the commands from above, but instead the ones from your own terminal.

Copy and paste the first line into your terminal. In this case, the first line is **(echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew/ shellenv)"') >> /Users/kennythai/.zprofile**

Copy and paste the second line into your terminal **eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"**

Once you have completed the previous steps, confirm the successful installation of Homebrew by running the following command.
```
brew --version
```
